#!/bin/bash

# Helper script which can be used to interact with docker compose and an
# an environment.

# The problem
# -----------
#
# We want to run our app in a number of different environments
#
# - locally (just running the things we depend on using Docker, but have our app
#   running on the host)
# - development (have our Rails app running in Docker in DEVELOPMENT mode)
# - test (run our automated tests in docker with the app running in TEST mode)
# - production (run the Rails app in PRODUCTION mode, but also mimic production
#   by having multiple versions running behind a load balancer like nginx. Also
#   have assets being served from the load balancer as we would in production)
#
# Unless otherwise noted, we also don't want to build different images and
# containers to support this. We want to keep build and load times down by
# reusing images and Dockers layer cache.
#
# So to allow this we lean into 2 features of Compose. Each are detailed below
# but their use has one other key impact. The length and complexity of the
# command that needs to be entered to run any Compose command goes beyond what
# somone using the project daily would be expected to run.
#
# This is the primary reason for this helper file. It can help those new to
# Docker and Compose, and serve as documentation for those who are familiar with
# it.
#
# Multiple compose files
# ----------------------
#
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/#specifying-multiple-compose-files#specifying-multiple-compose-files
#
# > Using multiple Compose files enables you to customize a Compose application
# > for different environments or different workflows.
#
# > By default, Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional
# > `docker-compose.override.yml` file. By convention, the `docker-compose.yml`
# > contains your base configuration. The override file, as its name implies,
# > can contain configuration overrides for existing services or entirely new
# > services.
#
# We leverage this by having the main file contain those services used by all
# environments e.g. the database and address lookup. We then have an override
# file for each environment type. With these in place you then need to ensure
# you reference both when running commands like `docker-compose buid`, `up`,
# `stop` etc.
#
# Project names
# -------------
#
# https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/#specifying-multiple-compose-files#use--p-to-specify-a-project-name
#
# > Each configuration has a project name. If you supply a -p flag, you can
# > specify a project name. If you donâ€™t specify the flag, Compose uses the
# > current directory name.
#
# What is not immediately clear is that if you ommit the `-p` flag and allow
# Compose to use the default name, you'll start getting warnings about
# existing images and containers already being used. That's because we have
# opted to name things the same across environments, e.g. `db`, `address`, `app`
# etc. The alternate would have been to always override the names in our
# override files.
#
# Using the `-p` though means we can set a project name based on our environment
# and this will be used when creating the containers. No more conflicts or
# warnings, and it helps keep everything distinct.
